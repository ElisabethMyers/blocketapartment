    "book": 'Look at this book, I think it is from 1996 when Blocket was born!

This concept positively impacts the environment and it is great other countries have followed suit.',
    "table": `Ahh you have found my CV and cover letter - <a href="https://github.com/ElisabethMyers/Resume" target="_blank">click here!</a>. By the way, most people call me Libby it is my nickname. You will see I have a lot of transferable skills, creativity and a never-ending thirst for knowledge. I need to learn a lot still, but I am willing to give alot in return, I just need someone to "take a chance on me" (too cheesy to quote ABBA here?). I have 1 - 2 years experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked with React, mySQL and Node.js, and have also used Redux. At the moment I am learning Three.js and continuing my learning of Typescript. This application is built with Kaboom.js. Hire me and I will spend day and night learning the frameworks you use!`,

    "armchair": 'Hmmm...a cup of tea should really be on this table',
    "kitchen": 'I am not much of a chef, however most people can make something edible with pasta right?',
    "fridge": 'I have been a nurse for the last 5.5 years so I do make an effort to maintain a healthy diet. I have a lot of team work experience, as well as, leadership and prioritisation skills. I think having a great team dynamic really contributes to individual wellbeing as well as overall productivity.',
    "oven": 'A signature bean chilli is sat here. Really hope the oven has not been left on!',

    "grandfatherClock": 'My future ambtitions involve becoming the best developer I can possibly be, and then share and teach knowledge to others.',
    "fireplace": 'I love the winter months, Stockholm is so cosy when it snows...',
    "sofaWithBook": 'I love Sweden, I studied Swedish for over three years and visit about 3 times a year! My current level is upper-intermiediate and I hope to take this to advanced. My native language is  English. I am a friendly and sociable person, so I would work in the office more than twice a week!',
    "teaTable": 'I have quite diverse hobbies - I love to listen, create and play music - I used to compose and produce music for advertisments and studied music technology for several years. I love to read both fiction and non-fiction books (especially those on history), I love to have fika and wine evenings with friends. My favourite band to listen to at the moment is Bon Entendeur, they are the ultimate summer listen. I absolutely LOVE a boardgame although I am terrible at reading the rules!',
